# Compliance, Audit Logs & Governance

> *“Compliance is not about paperwork — it’s about proving control.”*

This module belongs to **PHASE 13: Security & Compliance**.  
Here we focus on **how Datadog supports compliance, auditability, and governance**, using continuous visibility instead of periodic checks.

---

## What Is Compliance?

Compliance means:
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Following internal security standards
- Proving controls are in place

Examples of compliance needs:
- Access control
- Change tracking
- Data retention
- Audit trails

---

## Why Audit Logs Matter

**Audit logs** record:
- Who did what
- When it happened
- Where it was done

They are essential for:
- Investigations
- Compliance audits
- Forensics

Without audit logs:
> You cannot prove what happened.

---

## Audit Logging in Datadog (Conceptual)

Datadog audit logs capture:
- User actions
- Configuration changes
- Access events

Examples:
- Monitor created or deleted
- Dashboard modified
- API key changes

These logs provide:
> Accountability and traceability.

---

## Governance in Observability

Governance ensures:
- Standards are followed
- Changes are controlled
- Ownership is clear

In Datadog, governance includes:
- Role-based access control
- Approval workflows (conceptual)
- Naming and tagging standards

---

## Retention & Evidence Management

Compliance often requires:
- Data retention for fixed periods
- Evidence availability during audits

Datadog helps by:
- Configurable retention policies
- Log archiving
- Historical visibility

---

## Continuous Compliance Model

Traditional compliance:
- Periodic checks
- Manual evidence collection

Continuous compliance:
- Always-on monitoring
- Automatic evidence
- Faster audits

Datadog enables:
> Compliance through continuous observability.

---

## Integrating Compliance with Operations

Compliance should not:
- Slow teams down
- Block delivery

Best practice:
> Build compliance into normal workflows.

Observability data becomes:
- Audit evidence
- Change history
- Risk signals

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ Treating compliance as a one-time task  
❌ No ownership of audit logs  
❌ Over-retaining data unnecessarily  
❌ Manual evidence collection  

---

## Why This Module Matters

Without governance:
- Security drifts
- Compliance gaps appear
- Risk increases

With good governance:
- Controls are enforced
- Audits are smoother
- Teams move faster with confidence

---

## Key Takeaways

- Compliance requires proof, not assumptions
- Audit logs provide traceability
- Governance enforces standards
- Continuous compliance reduces effort
