# Cost Optimization and Governance – Summary

This page is a **complete recap of AWS cost optimization and governance**.
It brings together **pricing models, visibility, optimization techniques, and governance controls** into a single framework.

If you understand this page, you can **control AWS costs confidently at scale**.

---

## Cost Optimization Mindset (Recall)

- Cost is an architecture decision
- Optimization is continuous
- Visibility comes before savings
- Automation prevents waste

Cloud cost management is a **shared responsibility**.

---

## Core Cost Optimization Pillars

AWS cost optimization rests on:

1. Right-sizing
2. Elasticity
3. Pricing models
4. Visibility
5. Governance

Weakness in any pillar leads to cost creep.

---

## Pricing Model Recap

- On-Demand → Flexibility
- Reserved Instances → Predictable workloads
- Savings Plans → Flexible long-term savings
- Spot Instances → Fault-tolerant workloads

Choose based on:
- Workload behavior
- Risk tolerance

---

## Visibility and Control

Visibility tools:
- Cost Explorer
- Cost and Usage Reports
- Billing dashboards

Control tools:
- AWS Budgets
- Alerts
- Tagging strategies

Visibility enables accountability.

---

## Governance Best Practices

Strong governance includes:
- AWS Organizations
- Separate accounts per environment
- Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Centralized billing

Governance prevents:
- Uncontrolled spending
- Policy violations

---

## Optimization Techniques (Recap)

High-impact techniques:
- Right-sizing resources
- Scheduling non-prod workloads
- Auto Scaling
- Serverless architectures
- Storage lifecycle policies

Automation multiplies savings.

## FinOps Operating Model

Successful teams:
- Review costs regularly
- Share responsibility across teams
- Treat cost as a KPI

FinOps bridges:
> **Engineering + Finance**

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- No budgets or alerts
- No tagging
- One-time optimization
- Over-commitment to RIs

These patterns lead to:
- Cost surprises

---

## Interview Rapid Revision

**Q: How do you control AWS costs?**  
A: By combining right-sizing, pricing models, cost visibility tools, automation, and governance using AWS Organizations.

---

## Final Takeaway

Cost optimization is not about cutting corners.
It is about **building efficient, sustainable cloud architectures**.

Good governance:
- Enables innovation
- Prevents waste
