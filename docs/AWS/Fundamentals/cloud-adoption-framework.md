# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

Moving to the cloud is **not just a technical change**.
It is also a **business, cultural, and operational change**.

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) helps organizations:
- Plan cloud adoption properly
- Reduce risk during migration
- Align technology with business goals

Think of CAF as a **roadmap for adopting AWS safely and successfully**.

---

## Why AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Exists

Many cloud migrations fail because:
- Teams focus only on technology
- Business and people aspects are ignored
- Governance is added too late
- Security is treated as an afterthought

CAF exists to answer:
> “Are we **ready** to move to the cloud?”

---

## What Is AWS CAF? (Simple Explanation)

AWS CAF is a framework that:
- Breaks cloud adoption into **key focus areas**
- Helps organizations move step by step
- Reduces chaos during migration

👉 It is used **before and during migration**, not after.

---

## The Six CAF Perspectives

AWS CAF is built around **six perspectives**.
Each perspective focuses on a **different part of the organization**.

1. Business  
2. People  
3. Governance  
4. Platform  
5. Security  
6. Operations  

Let’s understand each clearly.

---

## 💼 1. Business Perspective

### Focus
- Business value
- Financial outcomes
- ROI from cloud adoption

### Key Questions
- Why are we moving to the cloud?
- How does cloud reduce cost or increase agility?
- How do we measure success?

👉 Cloud adoption must **make business sense**.

---

## 👥 2. People Perspective

### Focus
- Skills
- Training
- Organizational change

### Key Questions
- Do teams have cloud skills?
- Do roles need to change?
- Is training planned?

👉 Cloud success depends on **people, not just tools**.

---

## 🏛️ 3. Governance Perspective

### Focus
- Policies
- Risk management
- Compliance

### Key Questions
- How do we control cloud usage?
- How do we manage cost and security?
- Who approves what?

👉 Governance prevents **cloud sprawl and cost explosions**.

---

## 🧱 4. Platform Perspective

### Focus
- Infrastructure
- Networking
- Architecture

### Key Questions
- How will AWS environments be designed?
- How do we ensure scalability and reliability?
- How do we standardize deployments?

👉 This is where **architectural decisions live**.

---

## 🔐 5. Security Perspective

### Focus
- Data protection
- Identity and access
- Threat detection

### Key Questions
- How is data protected?
- How is access controlled?
- How are incidents handled?

👉 Security must be **built-in, not bolted-on**.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Operations Perspective

### Focus
- Day-to-day operations
- Monitoring and support
- Incident response

### Key Questions
- How do we operate workloads?
- How do we monitor systems?
- How do we handle failures?

👉 Cloud operations must be **automated and observable**.

---

## CAF vs Well-Architected Framework (Important)

Many people confuse CAF with the Well-Architected Framework.

| Framework | Focus |
|--------|------|
| CAF | Organization readiness & adoption |
| Well-Architected | Workload architecture quality |

👉 CAF = *Are we ready?*  
👉 Well-Architected = *Is this system well designed?*

---

## Real-World Usage of CAF

CAF is commonly used:
- Before large AWS migrations
- During enterprise cloud transformation
- When setting up landing zones
- While defining cloud operating models

It helps avoid **costly redesigns later**.

---

## Interview Tip

If asked:
> “How do enterprises move to AWS safely?”

A strong answer:
> Enterprises use AWS CAF to prepare business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations before migration.

This shows **enterprise-level AWS understanding**.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Cloud adoption is not just technical
- CAF provides a structured approach
- Covers business, people, and technology
- Used before and during migration
- Complements the Well-Architected Framework
