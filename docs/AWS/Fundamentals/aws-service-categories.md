# AWS Service Categories

AWS offers **hundreds of services**, and that can feel overwhelming at first.

The key to understanding AWS is **not memorizing services**, but understanding **how AWS groups them by purpose**.

Once you get these categories right:
- AWS stops feeling confusing
- Architecting becomes logical
- Interviews become easier

---

## Why Service Categories Matter

Without categories:
- AWS looks like a random list of services
- Beginners feel lost
- Wrong services get chosen

With categories:
- You understand *why* a service exists
- You know *where* it fits
- You choose services confidently

👉 Categories are a **mental map of AWS**.

---

## Core AWS Service Categories

AWS services are broadly grouped into the following categories:

1. Compute  
2. Storage  
3. Networking  
4. Databases  
5. Security & Identity  
6. Management & Monitoring  
7. DevOps & Developer Tools  
8. Containers & Serverless  
9. Migration & Hybrid  
10. Cost Management  

Let’s understand each **at a high level**.

---

## 🖥️ Compute

### Purpose
Run applications and workloads.

### Examples
- EC2
- Lambda
- Auto Scaling

### When you think “Compute”
Ask:
> Where does my application actually run?

---

## 💾 Storage

### Purpose
Store data persistently and reliably.

### Examples
- S3
- EBS
- EFS

### When you think “Storage”
Ask:
> Where does my data live?

---

## 🌐 Networking

### Purpose
Connect services securely and control traffic.

### Examples
- VPC
- Subnets
- Route 53
- Load Balancers

### When you think “Networking”
Ask:
> How do users and services talk to each other?

---

## 🗄️ Databases

### Purpose
Store structured and unstructured data efficiently.

### Examples
- RDS
- DynamoDB
- Aurora

### When you think “Database”
Ask:
> How is my data queried and managed?

---

## 🔐 Security & Identity

### Purpose
Control access and protect resources.

### Examples
- IAM
- KMS
- Secrets Manager
- WAF

### When you think “Security”
Ask:
> Who can access what, and how is it protected?

---

## 📊 Management & Monitoring

### Purpose
Observe, manage, and audit AWS resources.

### Examples
- CloudWatch
- CloudTrail
- AWS Config

### When you think “Monitoring”
Ask:
> How do I know what’s happening in my AWS account?

---

## ⚙️ DevOps & Developer Tools

### Purpose
Build, test, deploy, and automate applications.

### Examples
- CodePipeline
- CodeBuild
- CloudFormation

### When you think “DevOps”
Ask:
> How do I automate everything?

---

## 📦 Containers & Serverless

### Purpose
Run modern, scalable applications.

### Examples
- ECS
- EKS
- Fargate
- Lambda

### When you think “Containers/Serverless”
Ask:
> How do I scale without managing servers?

---

## 🚚 Migration & Hybrid

### Purpose
Move workloads to AWS and connect on-prem systems.

### Examples
- Migration Hub
- DMS
- VPN
- Direct Connect

### When you think “Migration”
Ask:
> How do I move or integrate existing systems?

---

## 💰 Cost Management

### Purpose
Monitor and optimize AWS spending.

### Examples
- Cost Explorer
- Budgets
- Savings Plans

### When you think “Cost”
Ask:
> How do I avoid overspending?

---

## How DevOps Engineers Use Categories

DevOps engineers:
- Think in categories, not services
- Combine multiple categories per architecture
- Optimize cost, security, and performance together

This mindset separates **engineers from button-clickers**.

---

## Interview Tip

If asked:
> “How do you design an AWS solution?”

A strong answer:
> I break the problem into compute, storage, networking, security, and monitoring, then select services accordingly.

That answer shows **architectural thinking**.

---

## Key Takeaways

- AWS has many services, but clear categories
- Categories give structure to AWS learning
- Think in problems, not services
- This mindset scales to real architectures
