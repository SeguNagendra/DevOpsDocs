# Compliance Programs and Audit Readiness

Compliance is not about passing audits once.
It is about **being audit-ready at all times**.

AWS provides tools, reports, and services to help you meet regulatory requirements — but **you must design for compliance**.

---

## What Is Compliance in AWS?

Compliance means:
- Meeting regulatory, legal, and industry requirements
- Demonstrating controls with evidence

Examples:
- ISO 27001
- SOC 1 / SOC 2
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA

---

## AWS Shared Responsibility (Compliance View)

AWS:
- Infrastructure compliance
- Physical data center security
- Service-level controls

You:
- Data protection
- Access management
- Logging and monitoring
- Compliance configuration

Auditors care about **your controls**.

---

## AWS Compliance Programs

AWS participates in many programs:
- ISO certifications
- SOC reports
- PCI DSS
- HIPAA eligibility
- GDPR support

These reports:
- Reduce audit effort
- Do not remove your responsibility

---

## AWS Artifact (Evidence Portal)

AWS Artifact provides:
- Compliance reports
- Audit documents
- Agreements

Use Artifact to:
- Download SOC reports
- Share evidence with auditors

---

## Audit Evidence Types

Auditors usually request:
- Policies and procedures
- Configuration evidence
- Logs and trails
- Access reviews

Tools used:
- CloudTrail
- AWS Config
- IAM reports

---

## Building Audit-Ready Architecture

Best practices:
- Centralized logging
- Immutable logs
- Least privilege access
- Continuous compliance checks

Audit readiness must be:
> **Built-in, not bolted-on**

---

## Continuous Compliance Model

Modern compliance is:
- Continuous
- Automated
- Measured

Use:
- AWS Config rules
- Security Hub standards
- Automated remediation

---

## Preparing for an Audit

Before audits:
- Review Config compliance
- Validate CloudTrail coverage
- Check access permissions
- Document processes

Never prepare:
> **Only one week before audit**

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Treating compliance as one-time task
- Manual evidence collection
- No documentation
- No ownership

These increase:
- Audit stress
- Risk of failure

---

## Interview Tip

If asked:
> “How do you prepare for AWS audits?”

Strong answer:
> By enabling continuous logging, compliance checks, and maintaining evidence using AWS Artifact, Config, and CloudTrail.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Compliance is continuous
- AWS provides reports, not compliance
