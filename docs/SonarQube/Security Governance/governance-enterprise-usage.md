# Governance & Enterprise Usage – Scaling SonarQube Across Teams

When SonarQube is used by a single team, management is simple.
But as more teams and projects adopt it, **governance becomes critical**.

This chapter explains how organizations use SonarQube at scale without slowing teams down.

---

## Why Governance Is Needed

In large organizations:
- Multiple teams share the same platform
- Different projects have different risk levels
- Compliance and audits become important

Without governance:
- Rules become inconsistent
- Quality Gates lose meaning
- Teams lose trust in the platform

Governance provides **structure without micromanagement**.

---

## Organization-Wide Standards

Most enterprises define:
- Common Quality Profiles
- Default Quality Gates
- Baseline security expectations

These standards:
- Create consistency
- Reduce debate during reviews
- Make quality expectations clear

Teams can still customize when justified.

---

## Team Ownership Model

A healthy ownership model includes:
- Platform admins (SonarQube owners)
- Project owners (application teams)
- Security stakeholders

Each group has clear responsibilities.
This prevents confusion and finger-pointing.

---

## Managing Multiple Teams & Projects

Best practices:
- Group projects logically
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Avoid creating too many Quality Profiles
- Review permissions regularly

Simple structure scales better than complex hierarchies.

---

## Audit & Compliance Readiness

SonarQube helps with:
- Demonstrating code quality practices
- Showing security review history
- Tracking improvements over time

Auditors care more about:
- Process consistency
- Evidence of review
- Trend improvement

SonarQube provides this automatically when used correctly.

---

## Gradual Adoption Strategy

For new teams:
1. Start with default profiles and gates
2. Focus on new code only
3. Educate developers
4. Tighten standards gradually

Forcing strict rules early often leads to resistance.

---

## Common Enterprise Mistakes

Avoid these patterns:
- Enforcing overly strict gates too early
- Ignoring team feedback
- Treating SonarQube as a policing tool
- Customizing everything immediately

Governance should enable teams, not block them.

---

## Key Takeaway

Enterprise success with SonarQube depends on **balanced governance**.

When governance is done right:
- Teams move faster
- Quality improves steadily
- Trust in the platform grows
