In Linux, **environment variables** are dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes behave. They are part of the environment in which a process runs and are used by programs to store configuration information, paths, and other data that applications might need.

### What are Environment Variables?

Think of environment variables as a set of key-value pairs that the operating system makes available to any program or script you run. For instance:

* A program might look for an environment variable named `PATH` to know where to find executable commands.
* A web server might use `PORT` to determine which network port to listen on.
* Your shell might use `PS1` to customize the appearance of your command prompt.

### Types of Environment Variables

There are generally two types of environment variables:

1.  **System-wide Environment Variables:**
    * Set for all users and all shells on the system.
    * Typically configured in files like `/etc/profile`, `/etc/environment`, or within `/etc/profile.d/` scripts.
    * Require root privileges to modify.

2.  **User-specific Environment Variables:**
    * Set for a particular user and typically apply only to their shell sessions.
    * Configured in files within the user's home directory, such as `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` (depending on the shell).

### Common Environment Variables

Here are some of the most frequently encountered environment variables in Linux:

* **`PATH`**:
    * A colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for executable commands.
    * When you type a command like `ls` or `vim`, the shell searches these directories in order.
    * Example: `/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`

* **`HOME`**:
    * The absolute path to the current user's home directory.
    * Example: `/home/yourusername`

* **`USER`** / **`LOGNAME`**:
    * The username of the current logged-in user.

* **`SHELL`**:
    * The path to the default login shell for the current user.
    * Example: `/bin/bash` or `/bin/zsh`

* **`LANG`**:
    * Sets the default locale for language and character encoding settings.
    * Example: `en_US.UTF-8`

* **`TERM`**:
    * Defines the type of terminal emulation currently in use.
    * Example: `xterm-256color`

* **`PWD`**:
    * The absolute path of the current working directory.

* **`OLDPWD`**:
    * The absolute path of the previous working directory.

* **`PS1`**:
    * The primary prompt string that defines the appearance of your shell prompt.
    * Highly customizable.

* **`EDITOR`** / **`VISUAL`**:
    * Specifies the default text editor to be used by various programs.
    * Example: `vim` or `nano`

### How to Work with Environment Variables

#### 1. Viewing Environment Variables

* **`printenv`**: Displays all environment variables and their values.
    ```bash
    printenv
    ```
    To view a specific variable:
    ```bash
    printenv PATH
    ```

* **`env`**: Similar to `printenv`, often used without arguments to show all.
    ```bash
    env
    ```

* **`echo $VARIABLE_NAME`**: Displays the value of a specific environment variable. The `$` prefix is crucial.
    ```bash
    echo $PATH
    echo $HOME
    ```

* **`set`**: Displays all shell variables, including environment variables, shell functions, and local variables. This output is usually much larger than `printenv` or `env`.
    ```bash
    set
    ```

#### 2. Setting Environment Variables (Temporary)

You can set an environment variable for the current shell session using the `export` command. These changes will **only last for the current terminal session** and its child processes.

```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello World"
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

You can also set a variable for a single command's execution without exporting it for the entire session:

Bash

```
MY_TEMP_VAR="Temporary value" my_command
```

#### 3\. Setting Environment Variables (Permanent)

To make an environment variable persistent across reboots and new terminal sessions, you need to add it to a shell configuration file.

* *   **For the current user (most common):** Edit `~/.bashrc` (for Bash shell) or `~/.zshrc` (for Zsh shell) or `~/.profile`. Open the file with your favorite text editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`):
 
Bash

``` 
    nano ~/.bashrc 
```
     
 Add lines like:
     
Bash
     
```
    export MY_PERMANENT_VAR="This is permanent"
    export ANOTHER_PATH="/opt/my_app/bin:$PATH" # Add to PATH
```
  
After saving the file, apply the changes without logging out and back in:

Bash     
```
    source ~/.bashrc
    # or
    . ~/.bashrc
```
     
* **For all users (system-wide):** This requires root privileges and is typically done for system-level configurations.
    
    * **`/etc/profile`**: Executed by all login shells for all users.
    * **`/etc/environment`**: A simple file where each line defines a `KEY="VALUE"` pair. It's read by non-login shells and some desktop environments.
    *  **`/etc/profile.d/`**: A directory containing scripts that are sourced by `/etc/profile`. It's recommended to create a new `.sh` file here (e.g., `/etc/profile.d/myvars.sh`) for new system-wide variables.
    
Bash     
```
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/myvars.sh
```
Add:

Bash
  
 ```
export GLOBAL_SETTING="true"
```
Then, source the script or reboot for changes to take effect.

#### 4\. Unsetting Environment Variables

To remove an environment variable from the current session:

Bash

```
unset MY_VARIABLE
echo $MY_VARIABLE # This will now be empty
```

### Importance of Environment Variables

*    **Configuration:** Allows applications to be configured without hardcoding values directly into their source code.
*    **Flexibility:** Easily adjust system behavior or application settings without modifying core files.
*    **Security:** Can be used to store sensitive information (though not ideal for highly sensitive data, as they can be viewed by other processes on the system if permissions are not strict).
*    **Portability:** Makes scripts and applications more portable across different environments.
*   **Automation:** Crucial for scripting and automating tasks, enabling scripts to adapt to different environments or user preferences.
