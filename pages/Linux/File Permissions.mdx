# 🔐 Linux File Permissions

Linux uses a permission model to control who can read, write, or execute files and directories.

## 🧱 Permission Types

Each file/directory has **three sets** of permissions:

| Type     | Description        |
|----------|--------------------|
| `r`      | Read               |
| `w`      | Write              |
| `x`      | Execute            |

These apply to:

1. **User (u)** – the file owner  
2. **Group (g)** – members of the file’s group  
3. **Others (o)** – all other users  

---

## 🔍 Viewing Permissions

Use `ls -l` to list permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

### Example Output

```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 alice staff  512 May 25 09:00 script.sh
```

### Breakdown

| Symbol    | Meaning                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `-`       | File type (`-` = file, `d` = directory) |
| `rwx`     | User: read, write, execute     |
| `r-x`     | Group: read, execute           |
| `r--`     | Others: read                   |

## 🔧 Changing Permissions

### `chmod` — Change file modes/permissions

```bash
chmod u+x file       # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file       # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file       # Set read only for others
```

### Symbolic vs Numeric Mode

#### Symbolic

```bash
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+r file
```

#### Numeric (Octal)

| rwx | Binary | Octal |
|-----|--------|-------|
| rwx | 111    | 7     |
| rw- | 110    | 6     |
| r-- | 100    | 4     |

```bash
chmod 755 file  # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file  # rw-r--r--
```

## 👥 Changing Owner/Group

### `chown` — Change owner

```bash
chown user file
chown user:group file
```

### `chgrp` — Change group

```bash
chgrp group file
```

---

## 🔐 Special Permissions

### 1. **Setuid (`s`)**: Run as file owner  
```bash
chmod u+s file
```

### 2. **Setgid (`s`)**: Run as group  
```bash
chmod g+s dir
```

### 3. **Sticky Bit (`t`)**: Only owner can delete  
```bash
chmod +t /tmp
```

## 📌 Useful Commands

```bash
find . -type f -perm 0777         # Find files with 777 perms
chmod -R 755 /var/www             # Recursively change permissions
chown -R user:group /home/user    # Recursively change owner/group
```
