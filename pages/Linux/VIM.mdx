# Editing Files with VIM Text Editor

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable and efficient text editor that is ubiquitous in the Linux environment. While it has a steep learning curve due to its modal editing nature, mastering Vim can significantly boost productivity for developers, system administrators, and anyone who frequently works with text files.

## Understanding Vim's Modes

Vim operates in different "modes," which determine how your keystrokes are interpreted. This is the fundamental concept to grasp when using Vim.

1.  **Normal Mode (Command Mode):**
    * This is the default mode when you open Vim.
    * Used for navigation, deleting text, copying, pasting, and executing commands.
    * **You cannot directly type text in this mode.**
    * Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode from any other mode.

2.  **Insert Mode:**
    * Used for inserting and editing text.
    * To enter Insert mode from Normal mode, press:
        * `i` (insert at current cursor position)
        * `a` (append after current cursor position)
        * `o` (open new line below current line)
        * `I` (insert at the beginning of the current line)
        * `A` (append at the end of the current line)
        * `O` (open new line above current line)

3.  **Visual Mode:**
    * Used for selecting blocks of text, similar to highlighting with a mouse.
    * Once text is selected, you can perform actions like copying, deleting, or changing it.
    * To enter Visual mode from Normal mode, press:
        * `v` (character-wise visual selection)
        * `V` (line-wise visual selection)
        * `Ctrl + v` (block-wise visual selection)

4.  **Command-Line Mode (Ex Mode):**
    * Used for executing commands that modify the file, search/replace, save, quit, etc.
    * To enter Command-Line mode from Normal mode, press `:` (colon).
    * You'll see a colon prompt at the bottom of the screen.

### Basic Vim Operations

#### 1. Opening a File

To open a file in Vim from your terminal:

```bash
vim filename.txt
```
If `filename.txt` doesn't exist, Vim will create a new empty file with that name when you save it.

#### 2\. Navigating in Normal Mode

*    **`h`**: Move cursor left
*    **`j`**: Move cursor down
*    **`k`**: Move cursor up
*    **`l`**: Move cursor right
*    **`w`**: Move cursor to the beginning of the next word
*    **`b`**: Move cursor to the beginning of the previous word
*    **`e`**: Move cursor to the end of the current word
*    **`0` (zero)**: Move cursor to the beginning of the current line
*    **`$`**: Move cursor to the end of the current line
*    **`gg`**: Go to the first line of the file
*    **`G`**: Go to the last line of the file
*    **`lineNumberG`**: Go to a specific line number (e.g., `5G` to go to line 5)
*    **`Ctrl + f`**: Page down
*    **`Ctrl + b`**: Page up

#### 3\. Editing Text (After entering Insert Mode)

Once you've entered Insert mode (by pressing `i`, `a`, `o`, etc.):

*    Type text as you normally would.
*    Use `Backspace` or `Delete` to remove characters.
*    **Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode** when you're done inserting text. This is crucial!

#### 4\. Deleting Text in Normal Mode

*    **`x`**: Delete character under the cursor
*    **`dw`**: Delete from cursor to the end of the current word
*    **`dd`**: Delete the entire current line
*    **`d$`**: Delete from cursor to the end of the current line
*    **`d0`**: Delete from cursor to the beginning of the current line
*    **`D`**: Delete from cursor to the end of the current line (same as `d$`)
*    **`ndd`**: Delete `n` number of lines (e.g., `5dd` to delete 5 lines)

#### 5\. Copying (Yanking) and Pasting in Normal Mode

*    **`yy`**: Copy (yank) the current line
*    **`yw`**: Copy (yank) from cursor to the end of the current word
*    **`y$`**: Copy (yank) from cursor to the end of the current line
*    **`nyy`**: Copy `n` number of lines (e.g., `3yy` to copy 3 lines)
*    **`p`**: Paste after the cursor (or below the current line if a line was copied)
*    **`P`**: Paste before the cursor (or above the current line if a line was copied)

#### 6\. Undo and Redo

*    **`u`**: Undo the last change
*    **`Ctrl + r`**: Redo the last undone change

#### 7\. Saving and Quitting (Command-Line Mode)

From Normal mode, press `:` to enter Command-Line mode:

*    **`:w`**: Save the file
*    **`:q`**: Quit Vim (only if there are no unsaved changes)
*    **`:wq`**: Save and quit
*    **`:x`**: Save and quit (similar to `:wq`)
*    **`:q!`**: Quit without saving (discard all changes)
*    **`:wqa`**: Save and quit all open buffers (if multiple files are open)

#### 8\. Search and Replace (Command-Line Mode)

From Normal mode, press `:` to enter Command-Line mode:

*    **`/pattern`**: Search forward for `pattern`. Press `n` for next match, `N` for previous.
*    **`?pattern`**: Search backward for `pattern`. Press `n` for next match, `N` for previous.
*    **`:%s/old/new/g`**: Replace all occurrences of `old` with `new` throughout the entire file.* *   `%`: Search the entire file.
*    **`s`**: Substitute command.
*    **`g`**: Global (replace all occurrences on each line).

### A Typical Workflow Example

1.   **Press `yy`** to copy a line, then `p` to paste it somewhere else.
1.   **Press `:`** to enter Command-Line mode.
1.   **Type `wq`** and press `Enter` to save and quit.
