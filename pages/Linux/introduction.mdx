# Linux - Brief Introduction

## What is Linux?
Linux is an **open-source**, **Unix-like** operating system kernel first released by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. It's the core component of many operating system distributions.

## Key Characteristics
- üêß **Open Source:** Its source code is freely available, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it.
- üíª **Multi-user** system , **Multi-tasking** capabilities and **Highly customizable**
- ‚ö° **Command Line Interface (CLI):** While many distros offer graphical user interfaces (GUIs), Linux is highly capable and often managed through its powerful **command line**.
- üîí **Security**  Generally considered more secure than many other operating systems, with robust permission-based architecture and frequent security updates.
- üèóÔ∏è **Kernel:** At its core, Linux is a **kernel**, the essential part of the OS that manages hardware and software resources.
- **Distributions (Distros):** To make Linux user-friendly, various "distributions" bundle the Linux kernel with other software (like desktop environments, applications, and utilities). Popular examples include **Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS**.
- **Stability:** Known for its **reliability** and ability to run for long periods without crashing.


## Common Distributions
| Type          | Examples                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Beginner      | Ubuntu, Linux Mint                |
| Enterprise    | RHEL, CentOS, SUSE                |
| Lightweight   | Lubuntu, Puppy Linux              |
| Rolling       | Arch Linux, Manjaro               |
| Specialized   | Kali Linux (security), Raspbian (RPi) |

## Why Use Linux?
- No licensing costs
- High stability and reliability
